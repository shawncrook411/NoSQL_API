## Description
This project is a demonstration of how to setup a Mongoose server and the routes associated with it. It has the capability to create users, add thought posts to each user and also add to an array of friends for each user. You can create, delete, update and get information about users, thoughts, and reactions to the posts 
## Installation
To install: clone the repo, and then run 'npm i' to install the node modules. You will also need to setup a mongo server running the command 'mongod'  From there running 'npm start' will start the server which can then be accessed by a program such as Insomnia 
## Usage
To use this project, the only way currently is via HTTP request software such as Insomnia. Run the server/database locally and then run requests to it
